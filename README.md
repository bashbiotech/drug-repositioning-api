## Drug Repositioning Python API

We have developed a python package to access Drug Repositioning programmatically. User can test the API by downloading this folder and run the Jupyter Notebook. In the jupyter notebook, user can learn to:
1. Browse the available graphs (in JSON) in Drug Repositioning
2. Download network edge and node tables for downstream analysis
